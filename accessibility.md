# Accessibility
We view accessible software as essential to creating inclusive experiences for everyone.

## Accessibility standards
Accessibility is a journey, and there are always improvements that can be made. We are working towards conformance to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) at Levels A and AA. We understand that this is a minimum level of accessibility and doesn't guarantee a completely accessible user experience.

## How we test for accessibility
We use a mixture of automated and manual testing. For manual testing, we test with:

- a keyboard
- screen readers:
  - NVDA
  - VoiceOver (macOS and iOS)
  - JAWS
- Browsers:
  - Edge (Windows and Mac)
  - Firefox (Windows and Mac)
  - Safari (macOS and iOS)
- speech to text applications
- Windows high-contrast mode
- browser bookmarklets 
- custom stylesheets using the Stylus browser extension
- Firefox's accessibility developer tools

For automated testing, we test with:
- axe DevTools extension
